# Python Solutions - Find smallest number
 
Assumption : Constantly increasing list of numbers has been given which are shifted right or left by k values.

## Write a program to find the smallest number in the list. Make your program as readable as possible.

*  Solution : Simple loop over the loop and finding the minimum

## Write a program to find the smallest number in the list. Make your program as efficient and fast as possible.

*  Solution : As this is constantly increasing applying binary search to have less comparision and increased efficiency

## Write a program to find the smallest number in the list. Make your program as extendible and flexible as possible.

*  Solution : Adding an interface for finding minimum and implementing it for numbers.
